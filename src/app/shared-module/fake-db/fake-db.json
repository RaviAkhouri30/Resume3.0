      "desc": "At Siemens, I began working on the SystemOne project, where I was responsible for developing the frontend using Angular.\nI contributed to multiple applications including ABTSite, ABTGo, BOSS Project Conversion, and the Performance Dashboard. My primary focus was on the ABTSite application, where I developed and enhanced key modules such as View Favorites, KNX PL-Link, MBus, Function Configuration, and built the Plant Configurator module completely from scratch.\nIn addition to this, I worked on the Query Generator project, focusing on UI enhancements and extensive code refactoring. I effectively applied SOLID principles and OOP concepts to improve code quality and maintainability. Specifically, I refactored the QueryGenerator (Building X) module by leveraging SOLID principles, RxJS, and OOP methodologies.\nI also showcased the power of AI by demonstrating a chatbot application built using GPT-4.0 Copilot, which not only manages tasks interactively but also understands and responds to user emotions. During this presentation, I highlighted how SOLID principles can be applied to improve code quality and enable future enhancements without disrupting existing functionality.\nFurthermore, I demonstrated how AI can assist in generating comprehensive documentation, including flow diagrams, class diagrams, and sequence diagrams. I also utilized AI to automatically generate unit test cases, significantly accelerating the development process."

      "desc": "I worked with Aflac Business Services, an American insurance company, where my role and responsibilities closely mirrored those of my previous projects.\nI also contributed significantly to the TVS Motors PIP App — a product-based company specializing in two- and three-wheeler vehicles. We were tasked with building the frontend application entirely from scratch. My responsibilities included implementing the login authentication, business logic, interceptors, validations, and designing a responsive UI for both desktop and mobile views. I integrated REST APIs seamlessly and applied OOP concepts to ensure the code was reliable, readable, and maintainable.\nThe Profit Improvement Plan (PIP) application enables employees to submit suggestions aimed at reducing production costs and increasing profits. These suggestions undergo a rigorous approval process, including finance and departmental reviews.\nPrior to this, I worked on the Sennheiser-EPOS Manager project, a leading company in audio devices such as headphones and earphones. Here, I played a key role in migrating the legacy application from AngularJS 1.x to Angular 11. My responsibilities included implementing business logic, integrating REST APIs, adding validations, applying OOP principles, performing unit testing with Jasmine and Karma, and creating interactive data visualizations using Highcharts."

      "tenure": "October 2019 - August 2021",
      "desc": "As an Angular Developer, I have been responsible for implementing business logic, validations, and integrating REST APIs. Additionally, I took on the role of Module Lead, coordinating the team to ensure smooth progress towards completing modules, functionalities, and successful UAT/SIT releases. I also liaised with the Release Team to manage deployments on SIT and UAT environments.\nI started as a Prototype Developer and quickly transitioned into full development roles. Over time, I have worked on several key modules including PVU, Budget, EDP, and currently lead the DDO module.\nIn the PVU module, I developed screens for the ROP sub-module. Moving to the Budget module, I created numerous common, reusable components and directives, significantly improving development efficiency and reducing complexity.\nfor the EDP module, I handled workflow integration and bug resolution, ensuring timely UAT sign-off. Currently, as the Module Lead for the DDO module, I coordinate efforts to complete the module and manage releases through SIT and UAT stages.\nTo handle screens with similar layouts but varying functionalities, I designed a configuration layer that breaks each section into separate components, along with a common configuration container. This setup dynamically manages different behaviors such as default field values, conditional field visibility, section addition/removal, and DOM content changes. A dedicated configuration service dynamically adjusts behavior based on view/edit modes, field validations, and access control.\nI applied OOP principles such as encapsulation, abstraction, and inheritance to reduce code redundancy and improve maintainability. Robust validations were implemented to cover both “save as draft” and “submit” scenarios. I also modeled data efficiently and built complete module structures from scratch.\nThanks to the reusable common code structure and OOP practices, development time was significantly reduced, code errors minimized, and debugging became more straightforward. Using advanced debugging techniques, I resolved SIT bugs promptly, facilitating faster releases.\nI also implemented state management within the service layer using RxJS BehaviorSubject, enhancing reactive data flow.\nIn addition to development, I actively participate in technical interview rounds for Angular developer recruitment."
