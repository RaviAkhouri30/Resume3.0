        api's and to implement Bussiness logics in client side application. We
        were given a task to migrate the old Application which was based on the
        angularJs1.x application to new technology stack using the latest
        version of Angular. We were also given the responsibility to do unit
        testing as well. I have used the oops structure, reactive form, rxjs,
        high charts and typescript features to accomplish my job. I have been
        awarded 4 times in row for my exeptional contribution towards the
        Project.`

        tenure: 'October 2019 - August 2021',
        desc: `As an Angular Developer, my responsibility is to implement Business Logic, 
        Validations and integration of RestApis. 
        Also Taken a responsibility as a Module Lead to make a coordination in a Team for smooth approach
         towards common goal of completing Module/Functionalities and UAT/SIT Releases, 
         and also coordinate with Release Team for Deployment on SIT/UAT. 
         I started as a Prototype Developer and soon moved to development and 
         I worked on modules such as PVU, Budget, EDP and now handling DDO Modules. 
         I also achieved an award for Outperformance in Q1. In PVU, I worked on a sub Module.i.e. ROP, after completing
          my tasks of development of screens for the same, moved to Budget, 
          create a number of common, reusable and efficient code like common components and directives for faster and more 
          efficient way of development to reduce the development time and complexity, then moved to EDP and given 
          the task to complete workflow integration and resolving bugs towards UAT sign off and then 
          given a responsibility of Module Lead in DDO Module to make a coordination and to contribute towards the completion of Module 
          and subsequently approaching towards SIT and then UAT Release. 
          To handle similar looking screens but with different functionality and behaviour using configuration layer, 
          created each section as separate components and also a common configuration component and container 
          that handles all the different child components. 
          The Configuration was created to handle the behaviour of different screens such as default fields values, 
          remove some fields and add some fields, remove section and add section, changing the contents of DOM. 
          A Configuration service layer is also created to dynamically change the configuration to handle behaviour 
          of view and edit case 
          and fields validation and access. Also, Implemented oops such as encapsulation, 
          abstraction and inheritance and also reduce the code redundancy to a large extent. 
          Implemented a robust validation for both save as draft and submit case. 
          Properly modelling of data and created a complete module structure from scratch. 
          Due to the implementation of common code Structure, the development time is reduced and making use of oops, 
          created a structure that enables reducing of errors/bugs and easy to debug. Using debugging techniques, 
          resolve the SIT bugs to enable faster releases and making the code bugs/errors free. Also implemented the 
          State management system in the service layer using rxjs Behavioural Subject. 
        I also take Technical Rounds as a part of Angular Recruitments.`
