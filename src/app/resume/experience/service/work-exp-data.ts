        <br>
        I have worked in one of the TVS Motors-PIP App (A Product Based Company into Automobiles (2, 3 wheelers Vehicle)), where We were given the responsibility to build the frontend application from scratch. I have implemented the login (Authentication), business logic, interceptors, validations and UI design for both desktop and mobile view along with integration of rest API’s. We have also used the oops concept to make the code more reliable, readable and understandable. 
        <br>
        The full form of Application is Profit Improvement Plan (PIP), through this application, there Employees will be able to suggest changes, which will lead to production cost reduction and increased profits. The Suggestions will go through an approval process including finance approval and department approvals.
        <br>
        Before this, I worked with Sennheiser-EPOS Manager (A Product Based Company into Audio Devices (such as headphone, EarPods and many more)), where we moved the old application which was based on angularjs1.x to Angular 11. We were responsible for implementing the Business logic, integration of rest API’s, validations, oops, unit testing (Jasmine Karma), hicharts.

        desc: `As an Angular Developer, my responsibility is to implement Business Logic, 
        Validations and integration of RestApis. 
        Also Taken a responsibility as a Module Lead to make a coordination in a Team for smooth approach
         towards common goal of completing Module/Functionalities and UAT/SIT Releases, 
         and also coordinate with Release Team for Deployment on SIT/UAT. <br>
         I started as a Prototype Developer and soon moved to development and 
         I worked on modules such as PVU, Budget, EDP and now handling DDO Modules. <br> 
         I also achieved an award for Outperformance in Q1. In PVU, I worked on a sub Module.i.e. ROP, after completing
          my tasks of development of screens for the same, moved to Budget, 
          create a number of common, reusable and efficient code like common components and directives for faster and more 
          efficient way of development to reduce the development time and complexity, then moved to EDP and given 
          the task to complete workflow integration and resolving bugs towards UAT sign off and then 
          given a responsibility of Module Lead in DDO Module to make a coordination and to contribute towards the completion of Module 
          and subsequently approaching towards SIT and then UAT Release. <br>
          To handle similar looking screens but with different functionality and behaviour using configuration layer, 
          created each section as separate components and also a common configuration component and container 
          that handles all the different child components. <br>
          The Configuration was created to handle the behaviour of different screens such as default fields values, 
          remove some fields and add some fields, remove section and add section, changing the contents of DOM. 
          A Configuration service layer is also created to dynamically change the configuration to handle behaviour 
          of view and edit case 
          and fields validation and access. Also, Implemented oops such as encapsulation, 
          abstraction and inheritance and also reduce the code redundancy to a large extent. <br>
          Implemented a robust validation for both save as draft and submit case. <br>
          Properly modelling of data and created a complete module structure from scratch. <br>
          Due to the implementation of common code Structure, the development time is reduced and making use of oops, 
          created a structure that enables reducing of errors/bugs and easy to debug. Using debugging techniques, 
          resolve the SIT bugs to enable faster releases and making the code bugs/errors free. Also implemented the 
          State management system in the service layer using rxjs Behavioural Subject. <br>
        I also take Technical Rounds as a part of Angular Recruitments.`
